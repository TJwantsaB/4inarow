So I'm planning to make connect four

Now that you have an idea, visualize the end result:

What does your program do?
	The program lets two players play for in a row in the terminal.

How will it work in a terminal?
	The program should display the playingboard. And ask each player alternately in which colom they want to drop a disk

Is it one player or two players?
	Two players.

Make sure that it satisfies all of the project objectives.

What does the program need to do:
	It has to display the playing board and update it after every turn
		How do I update the board? (maybe ctrl + L)
	It has to take input from the users for example: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 , 7 for each colom.
	It has to keep track of all the disks
		So that it knows when a disk is being dropped on another one
		So that it knows when someone won

FCK YEAH RIGHT LOL
